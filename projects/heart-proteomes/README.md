# Heart Proteome

This project aims to create an expression profile of the human heart. 

### Select datasets

For absolute expression projects, we have a set of rules to select the project to be annotated:

- Samples MUST be from healthy/normal tissues.
- For absolute quantification we will use only Trypsin-derived samples. We have decided that because, if we add more enzymes, more variability is found across experiments making difficult the final comparisons.
